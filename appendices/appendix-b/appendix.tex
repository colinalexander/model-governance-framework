\section{Appendix B: Deployment Approval Checklist (Mandatory)}

\textbf{This checklist must be completed and approved before any model is permitted to influence live trading or capital allocation.}

Completion of this checklist does not guarantee approval; it establishes eligibility for approval.

\subsection{A. Model Identification}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Model ID:}
  \item \textbf{Model Name:}
  \item \textbf{Model Classification:} \(\square\) Deployable
  \item \textbf{Lifecycle Status Requested:} \(\square\) Approved for Deployment
  \item \textbf{Associated Portfolio / Desk:}
  \item \textbf{Requested Initial Capital Allocation:}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{B. Context and Scope Verification}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) A completed \textbf{Model Context Summary (Appendix A)} is attached
  \item \(\square\) Declared Operating Context is explicit and complete
  \item \(\square\) Intended use is clearly stated and decision-specific
  \item \(\square\) Explicit exclusions are documented
  \item \(\square\) No implicit or undeclared assumptions identified
\end{itemize}

\textbf{If any box is unchecked -> STOP}

\subsection{C. Evaluation and Evidence Alignment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Evaluation design matches intended use
  \item \(\square\) Time ordering and leakage controls are documented
  \item \(\square\) Portfolio construction and costs match declared context
  \item \(\square\) Evidence presented is net of realistic costs
  \item \(\square\) Results are presented as trade-offs, not single metrics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes on trade-offs observed:}

\subsection{D. Robustness and Fragility Assessment}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Sensitivity to key assumptions has been evaluated
  \item \(\square\) Fragility regions are identified and documented
  \item \(\square\) No claims rely on single-parameter or knife-edge results
  \item \(\square\) Known failure modes are explicitly described
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Primary fragilities:}

\subsection{E. Implementation Feasibility}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Turnover and trading intensity are within feasible bounds
  \item \(\square\) Liquidity and capacity assumptions are credible
  \item \(\square\) Execution requirements are operationally feasible
  \item \(\square\) Systems controls can enforce constraints
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Operational concerns (if any):}

\subsection{F. Monitoring and Risk Controls}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Monitoring metrics are defined and documented
  \item \(\square\) Expected ranges and thresholds are specified
  \item \(\square\) Escalation triggers are explicit and enforceable
  \item \(\square\) Authority to restrict or suspend is assigned
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key monitoring metrics:}

\subsection{G. Capital Allocation Controls}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Initial capital limits are conservative
  \item \(\square\) Scaling conditions are explicit and non-automatic
  \item \(\square\) Reduction or suspension triggers are defined
  \item \(\square\) No reliance on short-term performance for scaling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Initial capital limit:} \hrulefill

\subsection{H. Independent Review}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Independent governance review completed
  \item \(\square\) Material review findings resolved or accepted
  \item \(\square\) Residual risks are explicitly acknowledged
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Residual risks accepted:}

\subsection{I. Compliance with Governance Standards}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Model registered and classified correctly
  \item \(\square\) Versioning and audit trail complete
  \item \(\square\) No unauthorized context or scope expansion identified
  \item \(\square\) No policy exceptions requested
\end{itemize}

If exceptions are requested, attach approved exception documentation.

\subsection{J. Approval Determination}

\textbf{Recommendation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \(\square\) Approve for deployment
  \item \(\square\) Approve with conditions
  \item \(\square\) Defer pending remediation
  \item \(\square\) Reject
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conditions or remediation required (if applicable):}

\subsection{L. Governing Statement}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Approval reflects confidence in how the model behaves under defined conditions, not belief in its universal validity. Capital remains contingent on continued adherence to those conditions.}
